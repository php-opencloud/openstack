`php-opencloud/openstack` is an SDK which allows PHP developers to easily connect to OpenStack APIs in a simple and 
idiomatic way. This binding is specifically designed for OpenStack APIs, but other provider SDKs are available. Multiple 
OpenStack services, and versions of services, are supported.

## Backward incompatibility

Due to new [object typehint](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/object-typehint) since PHP 7.2, class `\OpenStack\ObjectStore\v1\Models\Object` had to be renamed to `\OpenStack\ObjectStore\v1\Models\ObjectEntity` in [v3.0.0](/releases/v3.0.0)!
