Create Service
==============

In order to work with the service you have to :doc:`setup the client </setup>` first.

Service can be created via ``blockStorageV3()`` method of the ``OpenStack`` object.

.. sample:: BlockStorage/v3/create.php

A list of additional options can be passed to the method. For example, to change the region:

.. sample:: BlockStorage/v3/create_with_region.php
